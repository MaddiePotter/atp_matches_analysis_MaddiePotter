```{r}

#Exploratory Graphs

df_wins_loses <- df%>%
  group_by(winner_name) %>%
  mutate(wins = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(loser_name)%>%
  mutate(loses = n())%>%
  ungroup()

num_columns <- unlist(lapply(df_wins_loses, is.numeric))
plot(df_wins_loses[, num_columns])


```

##Height

```{r}
#Height Distribution

hist(df$loser_height, xlim = c(150, 220), ylim = c(0,120), xlab = 'Height in cm', ylab= 'Count of Losing Players', labels = TRUE)

hist(df$winner_height, xlim = c(150, 220), ylim = c(0,120), xlab = 'Height in cm', ylab= 'Count of Winning Players', labels = TRUE)


#Winner Height vs Loser Height
ggplot(df_wins_loses, aes(y = wins)) + geom_point(aes(x = winner_height), color = "green", position = "jitter") + geom_point(aes(x = loser_height), color = 'red', position = "jitter")
```


```{r}
#Height Averages
mean(df$winner_height)
mean(df$loser_height)

t.test(df$winner_height, df$loser_height, paired = FALSE) #p-value is 0.2, there is not a significant difference between the distribution of these two populations. Meaning there is not evidence to suggest that the height of winners is significantly different then the height of the losers

```


#Wins Prediction
```{r}
#It was interesting to explore height based off of the general shape of the plot() graph, but now I will look in to creating a model to predict wins

lm_wins <- lm(wins ~ surface + winner_height + winner_age +loser_height +loser_age + w_ace + w_df + l_ace + l_df + winner_hand + loser_hand, data = df_wins_loses)
summary(lm_wins)

lm_wins_1 <- lm(wins ~ winner_age +loser_height + w_df + l_ace + winner_hand, data = df_wins_loses)
summary(lm_wins_1)

#The p-value here is significant meaning that my model better predicts the data then the null hypothesis, however the F-stat is small considering the number of data points. I will further investigate this with some graphing and root mean squared error.
```



```{r}
#Based on my exploration in SQL I will also create a model to predict minutes played each game

lm_minutes <- lm(minutes ~ surface + winner_height + winner_age +loser_height +loser_age + w_ace + w_df + l_ace + l_df + wins + loses, data = df_wins_loses)
summary(lm_minutes)

lm_minutes_1 <- lm(minutes ~ surface + winner_height + w_ace + w_df + l_ace + l_df, data = df_wins_loses)
summary(lm_minutes_1)

#This has a significant p-value and a higher F-stat. I will also graph this and see how the model looks.
```


```{r}
library(Metrics)

#Adding a column for my predicted minutes and for my predicted wins

preds1 <- predict(lm_minutes_1, df_wins_loses)
df_wins_loses$predicted_minutes <- preds1


preds2 <- predict(lm_wins_1, df_wins_loses)
df_wins_loses$predicted_wins <- preds2

df_wins_loses
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

#Graphing my predicted wins model 

df_wins_loses %>%
  ggplot(aes(predicted_wins, wins)) +
  geom_smooth() + 
  geom_point () +
  ggtitle("Predicted vs Actual Wins")

rmse(df_wins_loses$wins, df_wins_loses$predicted_wins) 

#The root mean squared error is 5.49 wins, which is quite high and not ideal for this model where the number of wins tends to be very low. Meaning that potential variance of 5.5 predicted wins is not a very accurate model. This indicates that the model did not have enough information. This is also reflected in my visualization.

```

```{r}

df_wins_loses %>%
  ggplot(aes(predicted_minutes, minutes)) +
  geom_smooth() + 
  geom_point () +
  ggtitle("Predicted vs Actual Minutes")

rmse(df_wins_loses$minutes, df_wins_loses$predicted_minutes) 

#This model is predicting the minutes of each game with more accuracy then my win predictor. My rmse calculation also offers a fairly reasonable variance of 36.4 minutes.

```
